        <br>
        <br>
<ul>
  <li>With the exception of goods referred to in clause</li>
  <br>
  <li>The price of the goods will be as quoted on the web site at the time you confirm your order subject only to any inadvertent technical error for which we will not be liable. If you subsequently amend your order to add items, the prices charged will be those applicable to the new item(s) at the time that the amended order is confirmed. Please note that as promotions are offered for a limited period of time subsequent amendments to your order may mean that certain promotions are no longer being offered</li>
  <br>
  <li>Where items are ordered and sold individually by weight (such as certain fresh meat, poultry, fish, cheese or fruit and vegetables) the price of these items (expressed per kilogram or other appropriate unit of measurement) will be the price on the date that they are weighed. Although we have an indicative weight guide on the website, this is merely to assist your planning and the price you will be charged is the price for the actual weight you receive. In the event that there is a change in the price/kg between the time your order is made and the time the item is weighed and priced by the supplier, the price you will be charged will be the price at the time the item is weighed</li>
  <br>
  <li>Where applicable, prices include Gross and service tax (GST)</li>
  <br>
  <li>Each order you make will not include delivery charges free of charge</li>
  <br>
  <li>If your order weighs more than 10kg and reside out of Chennai then we reserve the right to contact you with a bespoke delivery charge</li>

If you are not satisfied with the quantity you have received we will arrange with you for non-perishable goods to be returned to us (please note that the goods must not be used and must be in good condition).

  <br>
  <li>We will not be deemed to be in breach of contract or of these Terms and Conditions as a result of any delay in our performance or failure to perform our obligations if that delay or failure to perform is due to any cause or circumstance beyond our reasonable control including, but not limited to, fire, flood and other acts of God, strikes, riot, accident, disruption to energy supplies, civil commotion, acts of terrorism or war, breakdown of equipment, road traffic problems</li>
